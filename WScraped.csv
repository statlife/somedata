5,ABOUT EXPENSIVE ALLEPPEY TRIP,"Alleppey one of the famous district in kerala. The real name is ALAPPUZA. It is one of the famous place in kerala. The main attraction is beauty of back water trip and tasty fishes.

In previous year I planned a trip to alleppy. It was a big family trip. Me and my husband was the organizers of this trip. My friend said to me this is one of the beautiful tripping place. So I forced my husband. finally he agreed to my argument.

But my plan was totally failed. Because it was a rainy season. We went their at night. In first day I understand, there is no good resorts or hotels. Every fecilitys are very expensive. Tomorrow morning we went boat jetty( boat stand) . Our aim was house boat trip. We already booked a 4 bedroom attached house boat. We are two family's. It was One day and one night trip. The total cost is 30000 rupees. It is very high amount for this fecilitys . I expect very lexuary fecilitys. But it was totally gone. Only food and accommodation needs this much money?

The only one benefit is enjoying the back water beauty. The another important thing I noticed that every product has high prices their. They are maximum exploited tourists. But fish dishes are very tasty. Especially my favorite Karimeen. According to me my alleppy trip was not successful compared to my another trip. Because my budget planning is completely failed. It was too expensive. But views are very less.",1

8,ALLEPEY- Waste of Time,"I am sankarsh and I am here to review one of the worst places I have ever been to. The beaches are also not very good and clean as many boats are accessed. The weather in this place is worst. And if it’s starts raining it will never stop. And resorts and hotels in this place are very less. Though accessibility to this place is very easy. Never ever think to go to this place. Instead you can visit thekkady which is nearby and looks very beautiful. And this place doesn’t look that safe for tourists as this place is filled with Muslims. You can visit this place but please don’t stay, it is not worth staying in this place.",1

great sight seeing. It is a very long beach and also near by saw a lighthouse there.

Pandavan rock is a kind of picnic spot. There we saw a cave and we got the

information that Pandavas were stayed inside the cave! one of the most wonderful place.

Sea view park which was very near to Alappuzha beach were boating will be

available and also we have to a ticket to go inside.

Chammanad Devi temple which was located on the highway. It was really amazing architecture.

Still there were several places to visit like islands, boating place etc., But due to lack of time we couldn't able to visit all places. Churches are available.

10,A must visit for Backwaters tour.,"We went on a weekend trip to allepey and had hired a shikara for boating. Shikara boats are available on an hourly basis and it's preferable to take a Shikara during the sunrise hour. The shikaras take you through the canals and lead

you to the enchanting scenic beauty of the backwaters. The boatman takes you through the channels of backwaters where get through the arch of coconut trees. The gentle cool breeze adds a sense of relaxation to your mood. And of course the boatman takes you to a shore where you get to have sweet coconut water and if lucky you get to take some clicks with the elegant kite. The entire experience was heavenly. It's a must visit for evey traveloholic person.",3

17,Beautiful place on this earth,"Hi, I wanted to share my personal opinion about one of the fantastic place on the globe.

Allegory is close to around 600km from Bangalore. The western ghat looks beautiful and it takes around 10hrs to reach. The speciality of alleppey is backwaters and boathouse. The cost of boathouse starts from 5000Rs. The AC boathouses are little bit expensive but really worthy which offers a cook to prepare food, bed, TV, 6 individual rooms and many more. The best food for non-vegetarian is karimeen. If you have 25k, you can stay for 3days easily.

it was our bad that we reached very late and to our surprise the boat which was reserved for us was take over by some local people(around 10) for boozing . The cook and the person who drove the boat were drunk. The cook was not even able to stand or talk properly. The food that was provided was not prepared at the time of serving the guy who served us just kept everything on the table and slept off in a room saying he had a bad head ace(which is obvious after boozing). The boat was not well maintained, the AC was not working.

Above all, after providing the feed back these guys says that they were not localite and they were from Germany(lol).",1

BUT things that matters is smoking, tobacco eating is fully abolished u just can't smoke in open, people around you will always warn you to lay your habit down.

33,Worth a visit only for it's Houseboat cruises!!,"We planned for a kerala trip during the month of December. It was on season so finding hotels were difficult. The last place in our itinerary was Alleppey or popurarly known as ""Alappuzha"". We drove our way to Alappuzha from Munnar. There are primarily two places to visit in Alleppey. One is Alleppey beach and the other is the houseboat cruises in Kerala backwater. To be honest it's a one day trip. Since we were not familiar with the places, so we stayed there for 2 days. One strange thing I noticed, there were no hotels/lodges near the railway station. The food wasn't good at all. Vegetarian food was little bit okay'ish type but non-veg was pathetic mainly because of the use of curry leaves & coconut oil. The climate was subtle as it was December. Also the place remains crowded with foreign tourists throughout the season.",2

We feel like we are floating in the water, when the cool breeze is making us very soothing.

But I felt very sorry  of the people living alongside of the shore, thinking  of their troublesome life. The people are very cooperative, even the Boatman!

And We stayed in Lemon Tree Resort  which was very comfortable and nice. The Kerala-style food was tempting!

But what I disliked was the  humidity and the narrow roads",4

What I want say about alapuzha is unfortunately negetive.this place is unhygenic area because of poor waste management and ignorance.so many rivers from highlands end up into this backwater carrying millions of tonnes of waste every year.and every contageous disease in kerala starts in alapuzha area.the water in alapuzha is so filty.we always avoid eating and drinking from alapuzha district fearing unhygenic and dysentry.tourists may not be so excited when they see filthy water and plastic heaps everywhere and the typical bad smell of that greenish water is not that pleasant.mosquito issue is severe.Always do take care about this when going for a nighttime houseboat cruise because at night the boat will be stationary for 6-8 hours so mosquitos will atack you like rockets.

.kumarakom is also a famous backwater destination nearby but way more clean and filthfree than alapuzha.services are a little cheaper too.please check out kumarakom before you plan an alappy trip next time.i would suggest kumarakom as an alternative.",2

Back Water cruise:

The Backwaters of Alleppy really make it a heaven and the most preferred place to tour. Alapuzha is blessed and surrounded with Backwaters in almost all the areas. This is the main thing tourists get attracted to Alleppey. Cruising on Water at alleppy is one the best thing I prefer to do at alleppey. Dont miss it.

43,Mosquito problems with worst water service..!!!,"We were 11 members in a group and opted a big boathouse to accommodate all of us.firstly, the food served was not that good.Then, as night arrived the boat was parked on a island.This was a nightmarish experience with mosquitoes.we thought of enjoying the night but were forced to sleep due to mosquitoes.t

Then the water given to there for bathing and all was very dirty(yellow in colour.etc .).If u like to go in a boathouse make sure u have the most expensive boat so that u enjoy the trip.or else don't in an economy boat.",2
44,Alleppey Tourist Atttraction By State Kerala,"On the day I arrived in Alleppey, and went to the stipulated destination to board my houseboat; I was made to wait for my houseboat; and that too I had to share till 3.30 PM with some other family.

Later on I was moved to a different private boat; but they also took some time to clean it and get ready for us; and we had to wait for some time for it to get started.

While we took some rest after an exhausting day; and later were enjoying the scenic beauty; the boat was put to halt and anchored on the shore at 5.30; citing govt. regulations.(But as far as I know, they allow till 6.00 PM).

Recently I visited Kerala for family tour and I booked the Alleppey boat house through Country Travel Mart.

The houseboat was very beautiful. The cruise members are very polite and helpful. The food given were very delicious.",4
45,Alleppey Houseboat - AMRUTHAM,"Thanks to Mouth Shut to share the Houseboat reviews about Amrutham group.

Hearing good reviews, my family traveled in 'Amrutham Houseboat Nov 2014'.

Excellent Hospitality and service. A Pleasant experience overall. Food, staff and service were remarkable. We stayed for 2 days in luxury super-deluxe category boat which was specially for our booking.

Thanks to chef and other crew.",5
46,Excellent Houseboat trip with AMRUTHAM HOUSEBOATS,"Thanks to Mouth Shut for helping me chose the best Houseboat in Kerala. I was really confused to select the boat for my overnight stay at Alleppey by reading many online complaints and reviews about many Houseboat operators. After a hard online search, I selected some operators like Rainbow, Angel, Amrutham, Nas, Atdc, JCT, Lakes and Lagoon, Kumarakom Houseboat, etc. Finally, Mouth Shut helped to select the Best one among them - Amrutham and must say, this was the best time I ever had in a trip. A beautiful individual boat with professional staff. A very good way to explore the real beauty of Kerala's own backwaters. exceptional food from Kitchen, spacious and beautiful boat, honeymoon specials, natural beauty of kerala, etc, etc  made my stay memorable one. We have already finalized the location to celebrate our first anniversary - God's Own Country and its lovely backwaters.",5
47,Amrutham Houseboats-Not That Great!,"I went by the earlier reviews to book in advance for Amrutham private Houseboat deluxe category. I was expecting a unique personal experience with my wife since I have heard a lot about it. But my experience with Amrutham Houseboats didn't turn out to be so nice.

On the day I arrived in Alleppey, and went to the stipulated destination to board my houseboat; I was made to wait for my houseboat; and that too I had to share till 3.30 PM with some other family. Later on I was moved to a different private boat; but they also took some time to clean it and get ready for us; and we had to wait for some time for it to get started. While we took some rest after an exhausting day; and later were enjoying the scenic beauty; the boat was put to halt and anchored on the shore at 5.30; citing govt. regulations. (But as far as I know, they allow till 6.00 PM).

Anyways, the food they gave was good. But the quantity was so less; that we couldn't get more of dal when needed. The cook didn't seem to be hygienic as he prepared the food bare-chested and sweating in hot weather. They were not courteous enough to ask if anything else was needed and we ourselves had to ask for more. In the night; there were some issues with power as it started tripping on and off.

Later on there was some problem with A/C; but it got resolved in some time. Next day morning; driver was slightly late to come and start the boat; and checked us out before time, as if in some hurry. I would say for the money spent; it was not worth it!",2
48,Naturevision Houseboats,"PLEASE DO NOT BOOK THROUGH NATUREVISION (Praveen Das)

https://naturevisionkerala.com/

Following are the serious issues we have faced during our stay in Houseboat which we booked through Naturevision.

The boat which was promised to us was totally different from what was given to us (photos are attached in the email send to my wife).

It was under maintenance, housekeeping not done.

Old Liquor bottles were scattered in Living area & bedrooms.

Spider webs were hanging over the bed and many other places.

Flush was not working, water was very muddy in colour and when requested for hot water in morning they didn't provided.

AC was promised from 9PM to 6AM but AC's weren't working in 3 bedrooms. Only in 2 bedrooms AC's were working (they had given 5 bedroom boat). In fact the AC remote is not working so we couldn't change the temperature.

Music system & TV was not working specially TV & CD player remotes were broken and not functioning.

They had promised detailed route map in the mail send to my wife (didn't show church, snake boat, village) but they just took us to some dirty place with lakhs of mosquitos & insects.

They had promised many dishes in the mail send but for morning breakfast they served only idly & old leftover sambar on previous night.

Mr.Praveen Das spoke very rudely on the phone when we asked to provide promised boat, he told us to get lost & he can't return advance amount and we were threatened to pay full amount.

Mr. Praveen Das & his Supervisor( named Lases) used foul language for the ladies (my wife & my cousin brother's wife).

While landing the boat they didn't stop the boat near the check-in point and forced to pay extra Rs.2000 for remotes.

Around 10-12 local goons gathered outside and were ready to fight with us.",1
49,A night in Houseboat at Alleppey Kerala India,"Recently I visited Kerala for family tour and I booked the Alleppey boat house through Country Travel Mart.

The houseboat was very beautiful. The cruise members are very polite and helpful. The food given were very delicious.

Moreover, there is no hidden cost for anything. It was really great holidays with my family as we are the only family on luxury boat having only one room.",5
50,The Enchanting Backwaters of Alleppy…,"Backwater places are really rare and peace loving people definitely enjoys it the most. It was our third centre in Kerala visit and the most thing I liked about it is the peace & calmness of the place. The Hotel we had stayed was also very lucrative, we had stayed at “Citrus Retreat” just at the shore; where the entry to the Hotel is to be done by a short travel in HouseBoat which is also a unique & joyous experience.

The alternative of staying in Alleppy/Kumarkom is the House Boat itself, but we preferred the Hotel instead of HouseBoat becoz of freedom to move out of the place. And Alleppy is just the replica of Kumarkom, though I have not seen Kumarkom but I prefer Alleppy over Kumarkom because of its a small place and can expect more of peace rather than a big place; (though Hotel facilities are more in Kumarkom as compared to.)  And it’s the main activity over there is that “doing nothing” and “just relax” forgetting all the daily chores and worries of life. It is said that Alleppy is one of the 50 must see places in the world declared a few years back.

I did not find any more of Sightseeing places, just we had a 1 hour Sunset House BoatRide in the evening. But more of anything else, the view that we had from the balcony of our room was the upmost. And we had enjoyed swimming in the evening followed by massage, so all in all it was comprehensive.

And to summarize, its just that, what I had felt at that place; that next time even if I don't visit at any other place and just come over here for 2-3 days, then also it’s a nice idea for a good relaxation.",5

53,NEVER STAY IN HOUSE BOAT,"I booked the house boat via KTDC, in Jan 2013 as a part of my Kerala tour. This boat belonged  to LAKE LANDS CRUISES, ALLEPPY Boat named "" DENIALA"" Our stay was full disappointment and life threat. Things started smoothly as in the evening they use to park the boat near paddy fields in back water, the place is full of mosquitoes, all boats were using mosquito net for the protection, but our boat driver named ""Sebastian"" in spite  of continuous request to put net said (1)"" the net are not working"" , and he along with helper Kannan left the boat, leaving only chef on boat when I called there manager Mr. Bijju his words were (2)"" this boat does not have any mosquitoes net"" this is our company boat and we very well know the boat this boat does not have a net, if you required the nets u shd have told in advance this thing. When we said that"" ur caeetaker of boat said they are there & they are not opearational"" he changed his words & told me these mosquitoes are not dangerous & even if they bite me & my kids nothing will happen to Us.

When further insisted for net. Manager finally told me to hand over phone to chef & told him something, chef then installed the net, by this time boat was full of mosquitoes, net worked in reversed way if securing all mosquitoes on the boat only. Now comes the captain of the boat who have also got a phone call from manager abt this issue saying "" what is your problem & harassing me saying many vips stayed in my boat including Mr Sharad pawar no one complained how can you complain against me, so many people come to boat, so many danger in water , boat sink you die, do u call my manager at that time. How can u call my manager at this time?

He further said(3) "" can u see it is too hot inside since you insisted to put nets"" I told I m ok with hot, but I can not let me & my family bitten with mosquitoes. (Till now I already had 3 excuses or not putting the nets) He got angry on us, showing all kinds of terror, if something happens to you in night who is responsible. You are not friendly what job you do, & etc etc...

Once I thought to get down from his boat, but they park the boat in middle of nowhere, where you will find nothing & with kids & luggage you have no choice but to stay on boat & be quiet.

I could not sleep in night, as I was worried abt the safety of my family members his intentions were not good. I came out of our room in morning, & I think staff had drinks & smoked in night on boat. Later they insisted me to write the comments & feedback on the moving boat. I told I do not want to write any thing, they said you have to write it now only not on the disembark point. I wrote nothing in the feedback page, but I wrote ""Food was nice"" in the register of boat.

After reaching the disembark point I headed to office of LAKE LANDS CRUISE, But to no surprise no one was there in morning 0900 hrs. They formed a gang in the last& came to me & told to feel up the feedback form, which I denied. I have put down a complain with KTDC & LAKE LAMDS CRUISE manager Mr. BIJJU, still awaiting for the action taken the culprit.

NEVER STAY IN HOUSE BOAT, rather take a boat ride & spend night in a nice hotel.",1
54,Wanna have a House Boat Ride....A Must Read…,"I am from Alleppey and I know that lot of cheating s are happening related to house boats.I you want to hire a house boat, you can straightaway go to the boat landing station(alias ''finishing point'') which is at a 15 MINS walking distance from Alleppey Bus Station.There , you can see a booking station for boats (Govt Operated, Yellow colored building) and book the boats directly from there.

They have got standard rates and packages and you will be having lot of choices of boats to choose from.The boats will be available from this place round the year and not need at all to prebook by giving double and triple the original charge, ,

59,Beware of http://alleppeyhouseboat.org/ crooks,"I booked a house boat from https://alleppeyhouseboat.org and paid rs12000 for a night stay.I expected a beautiful and neat boat but once I landed there what I got was a shabby and low class house boat which had mosquitoes, was not clean and was very small too.

These cheats were interested in only taking the money and not bothered about the service and maintenance of the boats as seen in their photos in the site.Beware dont get cheated like me.",1
60,"Beautiful backwaters, appealing houseboat","We had booked a 2 night 3 day trip through Global Vision https://globalvisiontours.com/.

To start with the pick up location was quite remote..but reachable. On arrival we were promised that we could make the balance payment by credit card. Sadly their card machine was not working and we were asked to pay by cash. We had clearly told them very well in advance that we will not be able to make a cash payment. Hence that was left to the last day.

On board, we were greeted and the crew were very friendly and the food was excellent. What ever rating I have given is purely for these.

The house boat in general was very poorly maintained. The walls had several stains on them. The curtains were dirty. The bathroom fittings were loose and leaking from everywhere. In one of the rooms, the plug point was loose and hanging out of the wall. On top of this, when we spoke to them about these, they said that these should not make a difference to us as we were  given good service.We argued that we were paying for the house boat as well, but this fell on deaf ears.Through out the interaction with them, the only thing that they were interested in was getting money.

So anyone booking through them, beware of what you get for the money you pay.",2

62,The Backwaters of Kerala,"We began our houseboat journey in the afternoon, having caught a bus from Fort Cochin. For once my friends and I were happy to hear the chorus of “hotel, hotel!” from the countless local entrepreneurs. I looked the first man who spoke and raised my eyebrows.

“Can you help me?” I said.

Of course he could.

I laid out our terms of travel. We wanted a houseboat to go take us through the back waters of Kerala for two nights. We could each afford twenty dollars each per day. Absolute maximum. Of course it wasn't really the maximum, but I knew if I stuck to that claim from the start I would come out paying it at the end. While it is normally an amateur mistake to begin bartering at the price you want, I had figured out the average price for other backpackers we had met and budgeted at about 20% lower than that.

After arguing for two or three hours and viewing a wide variety of sturdy and not so sturdy vessels, we agreed upon the price I had originally stated. The cruise was nice- we had warmish water, comfortable beds and a cook, Meals were served on banana leaves that had been cut from trees we had passed. Then the trouble began. We had assumed a two day cruise was forty eight hours, and the crew wanted to drop us off after only thirty. An argument ensued and the boat was docked. The crew left, and while we waited, they did not come back.

The only logical thing to do was drink beer. And the only logical thing to do following the consumption of beer was to contemplate our ability to man a reasonably sized ship with the set of keys had left in the ignition. The boat was started, and we somehow managed to turn off the entire boat's power. Then we managed to start the boat again, but couldn't quite manage to turn it off.

Then we left.",2

64,Bitter experience at Kerala houseboats,"We visited Kerala recently in end December which was the peak season. We had a wonderful trip in Kerala except its main attraction the houseboat. Due to peak season there were no houseboats available, and people were suggesting us for shikara ride. But one of the reputed houseboat operator gave us an package of Rs. 14000 in which shikara ride in the day time and then a houseboat in the night.

Mr. Ranjan, who promised about very good service took full cash and gave a shikara to ride. It was an awesome experience of shikara before the most bitter experience we witnessed in our trip. Ranjan couldn't keep his promise, and he asked us that he is unable to provide any houseboat. He returned only Rs.7000/-, which meant our shikara ride of 4 hours costed us Rs. 7000/-.

My friends, never believe on https://allappeyhouseboatpackages.com website.

Ranjan only talks sweetly before you give the payment, but afterwords his service changes. He didn't even give us the receipt of 7000.",3

One of my Friend suggested Amrutham Houseboats as the best in Kerala. So I called them and Booked a Super Deluxe Houseboat at Kumarakom. Frankly saying, the boat was really a Luxurious one. It was a Single Bedroom boat with a big Hall, Luxury furnitures, corridors, Upper deck, modern Kitchen, LCD TV, etc. Their Chef was an expert.He cooked Tiger Prawns, Karimeen Fish, Chicken and some other Veg dishes for us.all wer excellent.Other than chef, Driver and Assistant were there in Boat.They were really helpful.I never seen such Uniformed Staffs in any other Houseboats in Kumarakom.

Upper deck of the boat was another attraction.we could sit, relax and enjoy the beauty of the backwater at its full fledge from Upper deck.

They also arranged ‘Flowerbed decoration’ and ‘Candle Light Dinner’ for us .Even though we dint ask for that, since it was our Honeymoon, they arranged specially for us.

I paid an amount or Rs. 6000 /- for all these Luxury stay and I am sure that it was worth for all these Luxury amenities.

But never forget to select the best houseboat for your cruise.

I recommend Amrutham Houseboats for your Backwater cruise.in Alleppey or in Kumarakom.

Their houseboats are the best in Kerala. They are having all favilities like LCD TV, Music system, A/c Bedrooms, Conference hall facilities, Big Hall and Veranda, Clean and modern Kitchen, Upperdeck facility, Attached and well maintained Bathrooms, Hot water facility, Well Trained and Uniformed Staffs, etc.etc.

69,Allepey Trip costs,"Allepey is the best place I have ever visited in my life. Yes I have been an avid traveler & have traveled almost all parts of India.The place & other things are good but the travel operators can really charge you hefty while selling Kerala packages to you.

Two players I have found most reliable are Thomas Cook & Antilog Vacations. Antilog Vacations is the cheapest when it comes to Kerala.I got a 5 day Kerala package for 8000 bucks with 3 star hotels & a personal car & chauffeur. Houseboat was charged for around 3000 per person with all meals.You just can't miss allepey guys , its awesome",4
70,"No Allepey, Yes Kumarakom","Although both are near by. I would refer the visitors to choose Kumarakom over Allepey if time is not a constraint.

HouseBoat:- Beware of the AGENTS! Yes, they are there. Always in search of short cut money. Dont go to Allepey and plan to book a houseboat, rather book a houseboat and then visit allepey else you might end up paying twice to feed AGENTS...... The prices they quote go up to 12K, 15K an 17K a times depending on how soft a target you appear against normal prices of 6k to 7k for a night........ House boats operate from 12 Noon till next day morning 9 AM........ House boat only moves for

Motorboats:- Make sure you visit the inner narrow canals of Kumarakom which is only possible with small motor boats in the evening time. They charge Rs 350 per hour for the entire family. Two hours trip in the evening to cover vembanad lake and canals would be a better experience than any.",2
71,Houseboat - Lovely Experience - Seasonscruise,"We (group of 6) decided to embark on a backwater cruise and selected Seasons Cruise as it came to us with good recommendations from a friend . The interactions from the onset with Joffy (guess the Manager of Season’s cruise) was pleasant and he made sure an Innova (with a good driver) was present at Cochin airport to pick us. We boarded the houseboat called Grace at regular check-in time of 12 PM as it was drizzling at the boarding point (near Aleppey boat jetty). We had booked a 3 room air-conditioned houseboat for the Aleppey to Kumarakom cruise - each of the rooms was large enough for a couple and had a decent sized bathroom with necessary amenities. The houseboat has a sitting area in the front for at least 8-10 people and a full and well stocked kitchen at the rear. The lunch and dinner served was fabulous, both in quality and quantity, and comprised of fish , chicken and vegetarian dishes prepared in Malayali style (they can make North Indian varieties if requested early).

On the way we stopped at a fish stall and bought some crab and jumbo/tiger prawns (we may have shelled out a bit more than the actual price as we did not know the going rate!), which was as cooked as per our wish, which was very tasty too. The houseboat was docked for the evening and night at around 5 PM, when we were served tea and snacks. Since we opted for the premium package, we were taken for a 45 minute canoe ride through the canals of the lake where we were able to see the late evening activities of the inhabitants in the backwater area. The night

was pleasant and we as a group played games and heard songs from the CD player. This houseboat had an LCD TV but did not have a satellite TV connection,  We did not really feel the need to see TV/movies through our 1 night cruise. Finally a big thumbs up to the crew of the houseboat - Mathai, Brijesh and Jayesh, who played along with our requests and tantrums :). Service is definitely an USP of this houseboat. Some words of caution - do make sure you carry some insect repellent creams (like Odomos), lots of games (like cards, monopoly, etc), a good camera to capture your trails/memories  The sleep was decent and the breakfast was relishing too (our group folks are big foodies and can relish good food 24/7!). We finally were dropped off at the Kumarakom's boat jetty w The overall experience was fantastic and we thank Joffy and team for making our stay memorable and comfortable.",5
72,House boat experience in Alleppy,"Wish this review will help you in guiding your expectation about Alleppey Houseboat. I had visited the place with great zeal to enjoy in moving houseboat last June. I organised A non AC houseboat (since it was rainy season) with food &accommodationfor 7000 rupees. I had also visited Srinagar & stayed in houseboat. But the boats in Srinagar would not move & remains standing in Dal lake.

As the boat in Kerala are moving I thought it will be beautifulto spend the evening in the moving houseboat with our near & dear ones. we started in the boat little delayed & by 12 o'clock noon. By 1.30 approximately the stopped for lunch. After an hour break the boat again started moving & we have been enjoying. By 5o'clock the boat anchored close to some village.

All my request for running the boat was turned down by the boat personnel. The mosquitoes took charge outside of the rooms which had no ventilation as they were air conditioned rooms. We were in trouble as we booked non ac. Some how we managed the night. I felt completely cheated as we paid so much for just 4 hours journey. better would have been to take a boat for day travel with much much cheaper price.

The guys even stopped the generator twice to savediesel& we needed to fight. My request would be to take all relevant details of the boat befor you pay & get started.

73,Alleppy Backwaters experience,"I would like to share my experience at Alleppy backwaters a few weeks back. Second day of the arrival, we boarded a houseboat. We had booked a single bedroom houseboat through Global vision tours at https://keralahouseboat.org. Following was my experience with the houseboat.Pros:

1) Staff was courteous and helpful.

2) Food was goodCons:

1) The starting point is 15 Km from Alleppy, some remote place called Kainakkary. We struggled to find the place. Most of the other houseboat services start from Alleppy town itself.

2) The boat was not the one shown in the website. It was smaller and didn't have Wall Cupboards or Teakwood Wall Finishing as mentioned in the website. Flooring was cheap coir carpet instead of Vinyl Flooring. Toilet was stinking and very small.

3)A/C was without temperature control. It gets cool very fast and I had to get up 10 times to switch off/on to maintain the temperature.

4)None of their boats have Cable TV. rely on DVD's supplied for entertainment.

5) We found many luxurious houseboats available for the same rate at Alleppy. We enjoyed the trip till evening but night stay was not great. They stop the boat at some remote place and you are left in the company of mosquitoes and insects.

I would suggest to take only day trip in house boat and return back to a good resort. Also note that none of the Houseboat show you narrow canals and real life. Even the smallest houseboat cannot enter the narrow canals. Plan to hire a canoe and take a trip through narrow canals to get best experience of backwaters.",1
74,Travelling by Houseboat at Alleppy,"We had booked a single bedroom houseboat for 24 hours during our stay at Alleppy. The houseboat left Alleppy at around 11am and went around the backwaters till 6pm. After that it dropped anchor for the night.

One would fall in love at the first look of a houseboat. Ours was one of the smaller ones but just fit for two people. The open place in front was for dining. There was one bedroom with attached bathroom and the kitchen was at the back. There are double decker houseboats and houseboats with more number of bedrooms.

The tour of the backwaters from afternoon to evening was heavenly. This is one experience that one should not miss. The backwater is like the main road and service roads in any of our cities. There are water buses, garages for motor boats and small bridges like flyovers in cities. The lunch cooked by the driver and his helper was just awesome. Authentic kerala dishes.

By 6 pm the boat dropped anchor. It usually drops anchor on the banks of the backwater. The problem starts from then. As the evening progresses, insects and flies starts to come out of their slumber. We could not sit in the open spaces where we enjoyed our afternoon. To save ourselves from the insects and mosquitoes, we had to sit in our bedroom with all doors and windows closed. Soon it became suffocating. Had to switch on the AC and unfortunately the AC was too big for the small room. So whole evening and night was spent in swtiching on and off the AC. We even couldnt get out of the mosquito net. It was pitch dark outside and there was nothing we could do. We should have taken a houseboat with TV to spend the evening

So I would suggest tourists to take a half a day trip. Leave by 11am and come back to allepy by 6 pm. Its better to rest in your hotel room than in the houseboat.",4

76,A journey to remember,"In our package trip to Kerala, an overnight stay at the Houseboat was included. We boarded the Houseboat from Alleppey and believe me the trip was worth taking. The magnificient view of the calm Backwaters lined with Coconut groves on bothe sides of the canal and vast paddy fields lay beyond it.

Traditional Kerala cuisine was served on the House boat for Lunch, Dinner and Breakfast.

The room was very comfortable and the toilet was so neat and clean, we never felt it was a boat with all the modern facilities available . The boat had a deck on top of the roof with tables and small sofas to sit and view the beauty that the backwaters had to offer, one can never get this type of beauty anywhere. Truly Kerala is really "" GODS OWN COUNTRY""

During sunset the waters were glimming with the sunrays and the water all around had a golden sheen. When the boats are parked for the night you can have a walk around the small village and see Kerala more locally and traditionally. You meet the local people, shops and see the traditional way of Transportation in Kerala how everything can be transported by boat .

The morning was very different when we could feel the fresh air around the canal and how everything was so peaceful, calm and beautiful which we people are deprived of in our Daily busy lives in the City.",5
77,Awsome alleppey,"I've been to alleppey and its been a great trip for me which I would never forget. its been the most wonderful experiance of my life, well when we reached alleppy it was in the morning in the month of JAN. the awsome veiw of the place, the islands all close by. I was staying at my aunts house which was close to the beach. great view of water between the islands, and view of sunrise and the sunset. the view of the islands covered with the coconut trees cannot be explained in words need to have a lively experiance. the food was great which we had at the small restaurents well if you are a non vegetarian then you can feel the heaven. and the water sport like boat racing, speed boats made our day. im the person with the busy life but when I went to alleppey I was rechaged with the atmosphere and the climate. all I can tell you my friends that THE BEST PLACE I ever visited was alleppey.",5
78,Alleppey--The Venice of India,"Anyone who is visiting Kerala must visit Allepey.A great place with huge network of cannels and backwaters.I was on Honneymoon last year when I have visited Alleppey.We are amazed by the beauty of backwaters.I had accomodation in a off shore resort as I could not got a house boat.I was there in December.All the houseboats are occupied.The resort is kool with all the morden aminities.It a theam base resort all the furniture and interior are tradinational Kerala style.The food was great with lots of hurb and fresh spice which grow in Kerala itself.Idle which is staple diet in Kerala is best if you have problem with your health.You can take ride in many boats which are cheap(200-500Rs) for 2-3 hour.In september there is snake boat race which you can enjoy.I was there in December so I havennt enjoied the boat race but I was happy watching snake boat on shore.Snake boat can accomodate 100+ paddler

If you are a I suggest that anyone should plan their visit in advance and should book house boat if you have deep pocket..House boat costs you (6k-15k) per day.Depends on the size(nos. of bedrooms),facility(ac,kitchen,etc..) of House boats.Houseboats wihh take you for ride and ancher midway or anyplace as you like.You can enjoy exotic fish dishes if you prefer nonveg else veg food is also good in the house boat.Enjoy the food , drink ,greenery,backwater and open sky from the houseboat.",5
79,Monsoon Rainbow !!,"The monsoon had set in early...thunder, lightning and rain... perfect scenario for the car to break down while returning from Trivandrum at Alleppey !!! Late Friday evening the Mechanics had gone back and we were stuck for the night. A blessing in disguise !!

The Auto Driver, took us to a gorgeous place called Kayaloram on the Backwater. A Heritage Hotel that transplanted 100 year old Home Units from Kuttanad and remodelled it for todays life style. Open to the sky toilets makes bathing in nature a rewarding experience in the privacy of your room.The backwater is just a few feet away from the doorstep, and the everlasting sound of the waves is a divine lullaby. The sunrise early morning was spectacular. The Monsoon Rainbow against the background of Dark Rain clouds, is a sight beholden. And then the rain, incessant pitter patter of water. Just 12 living units , Kayaloram has a very friendly atmosphere about it. The Chef, will spoil you with Pearl fish ( Karimeen ) or anything you want and for the first time helped me cook too!!! The prices are moderate and definitely value for money.

Mid day and at lose ends we took a stroll. There are numerous low budget living units on the canal front. So good that it costs Rs 500 / - for a night with food.We liked Malayalam near the Punnamada jetty the best !!

For lunch our friendly Auto Driver recommended Allai's ... Its an old restaurant managed by a Muslim family and their Biriyani was out of the world. Cost .. Rs 70 / -.Having tasted success we asked for more. Took the boat ride into the Backwater and went to a place called the Marthandam Island next to R Block. A real country side joint, with a view thats exotic. It was Fish and more fish !!! Off the beaten track, not many go here but for the locals. So those of you planning a trip .. do jot it down !!

Back at Kayaloram, we sat on the lakefront and had dinner.Off season, we were the only occupants !!! The rain, croaking of frogs and the smell of earth, no wonder they call ..Kerala .. Gods own country !!!",4
80,Quick Tips on stay in Allepy.,"Hi Friends ! This is for all who desperatly seek helpful and concrete info on tourist destinations before they actually visit the place. This one is on Alleppey. First you want to know if its actually worth a visit, then you move to accomodation , food and finally expenditure. FLY TO ALLEPPEY: I flew to Alleppey from Delhi, saved a lot of time, so if you want full worth of your trip, take a flight, that ways you will have more time in hand to see the place, though there ain't much to see in terms of monuments or other historic places but the beauty of the place is divine and you need atleast 2 days to soak it in and bring it back with you , to keep you charged up till another trip. ACCOMODATION: There are all kinds of accomodations available, ranging from luxury to budget. I stayed in Kerala Heritage home , the room was for Rs 400 (non AC) so you can imagine an AC room would not be more than 1000. This place where I stayed was quiet , very peaceful, staff was very helpful, overall it was homely experience. There are quite a few hotels with reasonable room rents. FOOD: It is South Indian, lots of Sea Food and very little North Indian veg.. North Indian Veg. is not tasty and all Daals taste like Samber. So if you are non-Veg or can manage with South Indian then you'd have no problem otherwise you would not be looking forward to daily meals. PEOPLE: The people here are very very nice and really helpful. I found people in Kerala very honest, accomodating, helpful and hospitable.If you are stuck somewhere they would help and guide you. Cruise: The best thing is to take up an accomodation first and then go out looking for a back water cruise, this way you would have time to relax and then choose kind of cruise u intend to take , could be a cruise for a few hours or the whole day. Its ideal to take a cruise early morning or in the evening since the afternoon sun would prevent you from enjoying the scenic beauty to its fullest. Usually the hotels that you stay in will offer you the cruise, but if you are a low-budget traveller, its best to visit the backwaters and take a cruise from there - the price is marginally negotiable. To be honest you can cover the entire backwater in 3-4 hours, you need to hire a house boat only if you are with friends or cousins (I mean if you are 5-6 adults)or else if you are a honeymooner and want that romantic experience on sea, still I would not recommend spending large a/m on houseboat for the entire day. I hope this information has been of some help. Thanks Sidds.",4
81,Simply BEAUTIFUL,"When I say beautiful it has to be beautiful...i never praise a place unless I like it that good...when u start reaching alleppey u can see the difference...canals..boats..water all around...and the best of all...the traditional buildings..no you wont find many new rise buildings here...the scenic beauty when it rains is incredulous...with all the greenery of rice paddy fields stretching into acres and acres of land...you definitely wouldnt want to walk away ....The boat rides start from allepey near the kerala road transport corporation..where you will find official kerala tourism offices from where you can decide on boats and all..they will even arrange for stay in the scenic places of kuttanad-where an enjoyment of traditional kerala food can be had..there are even families ready to take care of you..and believe me they are cheap..you can get information for that at the tourism offices too....

the place is incredible and if you have time take a week out for this trip..and if you want great times there is Taj kumarakam not too far from here too ..there is mararikulam resorts which is great..the alleppey beach is good..

Dont miss it!!! believe me!!!",5
82,Allepy House Boat,"During this april we booked for Allepy backwaters Houseboad 1 day stay. Its off season , so got rates at Rs5000.

They give warm welcome by tender cocunut waters...language of communication was english... so no worries....Route taken was whole back water..big lake ...by lanes of people residing in those places.

Its really awawsome experience. A great time and great moment which u always remember and cherish. Beautiful way spending in Backwaters of kerela.

You feel in central of natural place . cocunut trees across and nice waters .coool breaze, well as its costly afair just 1 day stay of 5000, and this is off season, we found most of tourist were fouriegner. But yeh its worth to have a one night stay ..rather than just go for hours trip and be back.",5
83,No wonder its gods own country…,"No wonder why kerala is called as gods own country!!!!!!!!!!

Last week I got the chance to be in alleppey, it will be injustice if I dont write a few words about my travel...if this inspires atleast one person I will be feeling great!!!!

one should travell in a kettuvallam to enjoy all the beauty of backwaters...

is a kind of house boat in Kerala, Kettuvallam literally means ''bundle'' or ''package'' boat (Kettu means tied with ropes, and vallam means boat - Malayalam language).

and ofcourse the taste of kerala special disheS especialy when you have it WITH the beauty of sunset!!!its AMAZING!!!!!We had karimeen pollichathu which is specially made for us by the ''inhouse chef''with appam..is mouthwatering...''tempting me to be there in all the vaccaton''

and my suggestion is : try tasting the ''kakka irachi'' which you get in small toddy shops .....

The town of Alapuzha (also known as Allepey), is sometimes called the ''Venice of the East'' for its large network of canals that meander through the town. The Vallam Kali (the Snake Boat Race) held every year in August is a major attraction, one should not misss!!!

have a nice trip!!!",4
84,Alleppy-Kayaloram Lake View Resort,"It was amzaging trip to Kayaloram.

I have started from Bnagalore by KSRTC - Volvo bus from Majestic bus stop @ 5:30 PM, the journey. The bus is very clean and the hopitality of the bus staff is very good. They have stopped near a good hotel for dinner. The journey was very comfortable, they didn't played any movies in the bus due to request from passengers as there are people from different parts of india.

We exactly reached alleppy at 5:30 AM (its 12 hours journey), then we waited there for an auto, finally we got one after 10 minutes wait, the place is ''Punnamada'', he asked us to pay 25 rupees, we reached resort in 15 minutes. The view inside resort is too good, we are lucky to see the sunrise from back waters. The resort is faced to back waters.

There is a well maintaied swimming pool, old fashoined rooms, with out any disturbance like phones, TV etc., topless bathrooms, but we do have a common area where we have television and news paper available. The hospitality is very good.

Rooms are good, u cannot expect more luxourious rooms like in star hotels.

If you want to go to alleppy city you can ask the reception they will arrange auto / taxi for you, which is very expensive, one thing I have observed there is, wherever you go they charge more from tourits.

I carried some ready to eat MTR food and some pasturised nandini milk.

If you want u can sleep on the nets tied with coconut trees, or u can ask for stick for fishing.

We have some books to read. The weather was very good, our travel date was from 22 - 25th of april.

We spent one day in the resort only. The other day our house boat journey starts @ 12 noon, it was amzing, they provide three servants to take care of you, the boat house is having single bhk (U CAN FIND BOATS WITH 10 BHk ALSO) before checking in to boat he will ask ur mean preference accordingly he will bring the fresh stuff from market. The food is buffet per head per meal 300 rupees, they will give some complimentary fruits.

They will take you to the evening sunset, after 7 pm they will stop the boat, where you will feel very bored, I prefer to come back directly to the resort after 7pm otherwise you will feel very bored.

I have booked this holiday through RCI for three nights and two days it costs me 8500 inclusive all taxes. They say checkin time as 10 am and check out time as 11 am , so u negotitate with them for your convenient timings, becuase if u travel by bus u will be reaching early morning.

While coming back I asked for taxi till cochin airport, they are asking 1100 for non AC car and 1500 for AC car, which is very expensive for a 90 KM distance.

The good thing you have to do is (if you have low budget ) take bus to Aluva ( you have very frequest Kerala state buses ) this place is located after cochin, then the bus will take diversion to aluva town from the high way, u get down there, if u need any help ask conductor and tell them that we want to go to airport, so that he will tell you where to get down in aluva, otherwise u have to come all the way from inside aluva town to back to the same junction, from here u take auto, the cochin airport is 10 KM away from here, auto wala will charge you some where around 100 (actually it should be 50 rupess, what to do we are tourists :-) ) then u will reach airport. The cochin airport is very well organized and clean, u can fell very happy once u get inside.

I traveled back to bangalore by jet airways night 8PM, it's one hour fly, reached bangalore by 9PM.

I hope this is very much useful",4
85,Nice alleppey beach resorts,"Hello,

i did spend 8 days in alleppey beach resort, in the beginning I supposed to stay just few days but the nice behaviour and the beautiful resort made me change my plans.

i'm a single european lady traveller and I found the beach extremely safe even for me alone wearing swimmwear, anyway the very professional and friendly staff were there discretely taking care of me... I saw very rarely fishermen on the beach, and I think is a good ensurance about the freshness of the fish! anyway I don't felt stared!!!they are occupied to bring bread to the family, to be a fisherman have to be hard... the beach is clean and sure sometimes you see locals taking a walk...many times families...i talk with them...i found them friendly,,,you can meet nice people too.

the resort is extremely clean, the staff is very professional, they helped me lot and the managemet is very good and the restaurant too.. a german friend recommended me the place, I will go back and recommend it to my friends.

86,Alleppey Beach Resorts-a lovely getaway,"Hi,

I just got from Alleppey Beach Resorts...i just love this place since its a superb getaway from city life...the resort is just about 30 mts from the shore line and the beach sand is within the compund itself..just like having the beach at you door step..literally!

My booking was initially for 3 days..but due to the wonderful ambience it provided ,i extended the stay for another 2 days.

The beach is just great..i just dont know what some people mean by saying the beach was ''not private'' ...there was a great deal of privacy...my self and my wife had no problem with any local men ''staring'' at us in a ''very threatening'' manner.and what do some people expect to find at a beach other than fishermen...high rise apartments or perhaps factories that dump a lot waste into it??!!! looks like toxic waste is no problem to them!

..the beach was clean too..compared to the public section of the beach about 200 mts away..which was full of people and hawkers..

the food is just lip smacking...this is because what is served here is the fresh catch

of the day.. the taste of Karimeen fry still lingers in my mouth.

The management and the staff was also very helpful...they even helped me plan out the rest of my kerala trip.

To sum up I would recommend this place to everyone",5
87,Walking with the Gods,"You got to hand it to 'em, ''God's Own Country'', has rather a romantic ring to it, no? Having grown up with a gaggle of Malayali friends in Itanagar, Kerala, where these guys disappeared into at least once every couple of years, was always a place that was intriguing. This guys always brought back with them stories of Onam, snake-boats, coconut tree and banana chips. Well, to cut this nostalgic trip short, I have always wanted to visit Kerala.

Opportunity presented itself in form of a missus-on-warpath, who hadn't been taken on a vacation for years. Between the missus's persistent demand of Paris and my limited imagination that ventured no further then Nandi Hills, Kerala was a God-sent brain-wave.

Getting There

The weekend before Diwali saw us on Kanyakumari express. I can't sleep when people snore and people invariable make it a point to do so when they are on the same compartment as me on a train. Regardless of whether it is Karma or a CIA conspiracy, I was still up in the wee hours of the morning as Airtel-Kerala SMSed an welcome.

The Ernaculum station followed suit a short while later and we disembarked to the sights and sounds of Kerala.

Hammock Travels, who always overcharge, had advised a Taxi from Enakulum to Alleppy, a idea so dumb that it took winds out of the your garden variety bad ideas, we jettisoned it promptly on reaching there. Experience has taught me not to take long rides on beat-up taxis, on bad roads especially on a hot day.

The missus having heard an announcement of a local train to our destination had me scoot for tickets and soon we were chugging along again under what was turning out to be a rather a humid day along with being a hot one. The greenery around us, though, was remarkable. And as the train moved along, the small stations at each of which it religiously took a breather were so like the small stations of rural Bengal. I got nostalgic all over again.

Flash-back: 1980s, Still in Itanagar and No TV. A Phillps radio was the family pride and source of all things wondrous. Much abused by bro and me when Dad's back was turned. It also contained the list of stations that the contraption was supposed to tune into. Alleppy was mentioned. The name and the radio resurfaced in memory as the trained ambled through an amazing landscape. Flash back has no purpose, I just though about it then and thought it was cool, though now I can't imagine why. Strange are the workings of brain that has survived a night of snores.

Finally the train would go no further and we had arrived at Alleppy.

At Alleppy

Alleppy, which the locals call Allapuzah, could be Lakhimpur or Dhakiajuli or even the sub-urbs of Silchar, replace the script in the road signs by Bengla/Assamese script you wouldn't know that this was a place a sub-continent away from rural Assam or Bengal. The one addition were the water canals that were all over the town and have a uncanny habit of being with you whichever road you are in. A typical small town and I fell in love immediately. Laid back, slow and totally Indian.

Kayaloram resort, where a series of Ayurvedic adventures were waiting for me is a nice place. In the banks of a Back water lake it is quite well maintained. But first an afternoon of sleep was in order...

Evening, a launch ride. Ambitiously called the Sunset Cruise. Quite nice. Food and more Sleep.

Morning the next day, an unrepentant Management says, our planned house boat had unplanned problems and won't we rather get started with the Ayurveda anyway?

Here is a word of advice, if you are not of strong body and spirit, don't leave yourself to the mercies of a Kerala masseur. I am quite strong and spirit has never been in short supply , but the massage was something that I am not going to forget in quite a while.

I would highly recommend the Siro-Dhara therapy though. About two liters of scented hot oil is poured on your head from an earthen vessel that is hanging on a rope and has a small opening through which the oil seeps out and falls on your head. It is a very relaxing experience.

The food in Kerala is good. The Appams, idiappams with Kerala Fish curry is just divine to the palate. And if you are adventurous enough to wash this down with some freshly tapped Coconut sap you could well imagine that this must be the lives that Gods lead.

Afternoon was for lazing about a little. There were a couple of Hammocks strung on coconut trees and made for a nice place to catch a snooze. Evening and more good food.

The House Boat

We had planned to stay one day on a house boat. The boat the came to pick us up on the Resort deck was a piece of history as we were to learn later. Anyway we embarked on our journey. We were the only passengers on our boat that came equipped with its own kitchen, cook, boatman and handyman.

The boat lazily took us across the canals of Alleppy and after an hour or so of ride stopped for all to have lunch which was very tastefully prepared. After lunch we started again. Our boat had a nice veranda where you could go out and see the wonderful scenery pass-by. The boat man spoke no tongue that we understood so we would communicate with wild gestures.

It is actually for this part that people usually take the House boat. Going through the canals within Alleppy is an unforgettable experience. However we slept through most of it so there is little to forget anyway.

When we got up the boat was almost ready to drop anchor for the night. It stopped on a deserted place and the dim lights of the boats came on followed by tea and cookies.

As the dusk descended the whole place started acquiring a dream-like look. The environ around us started getting dark around us rapidly, even the water on which the boat was swaying mildly became deliciously black. The ubiquitous coconut trees on the banks appeared silhouetted against a sky that was only a shade lighter. From our vintage at the Veranda we could see other boats anchored at some distance with their dim lights on. It was so surreal that I couldn't resist making it even more so. I sang old sad songs of Hemant, Rafi and Kishore Kumar. The mosquitos, I am certain, enjoyed the company.

Dinner was as well cooked as the lunch had been. While serving us the dinner, the cook told us that this was probably the oldest boat on the backwaters and this was the last journey before it went for renovation. The old lady had been riding these waters for more then a decade now. It was so strange, the boat had probably made its maiden ride when we (the missus and I) left our college and its last ride was with us as passengers. Gave you a feeling that all this years it was waiting for us in a Karmic kind of way. :)

The next morning we went back to the resort and bid our boat people good bye. They had been excellent hosts.

The Last Day

The last day was blissfully uneventful. The missus took the treatments that she had been taking and I just lazed around more. It was the Day of Diwali. There were a few industrious people at the resort, who in the evening arranged for a small puja and pedas were distributed. We all sang ''Jai Jagadisha Hare''.

It atmosphere there had really relaxed us and after a long time the missus and I really talked. And talk we did, well into the deep night. For me this was the highest point in a truly wonderful break.

Bidding Goodbye

The next morning we started back. Relaxed, Renewed and Rediscovered......",5
88,Black Waters,"This is specifically for the Over night house boat ride in an around Alleppey. I wish all will read the review before planning any trip for Kerela.

I planned a 6 day long vacation including travel (by train) for kerela. This included 3 days in Munnar and 1 day in the house boat at alleppey.

Munnar is really a wonderful place with nice weather, nice people and an ambience of a true hill station, not to forget the lush green mountains all along with every bit of them covered with tea plants. You can read other reviews about Munnar and find out it’s really a place worth visiting.

Well, after staying in such a beautiful place for 3 days I started for Alleppey. We were 6 people (3 couples) and booked a 3 bedroom house boat for Rs. 12000/- for us. Indeed an amount of 4000 (per night, per couple) made us to carefully think over this option initially, but we spoke with our tour operator (Cozy Tours) and they convinced us about the facilities in the boat. And the feeling of traveling in water all night thrilled us, to go for it.

Normally the check-in time for such boats is 11:00 AM and check-out at 9:00 AM next day. They keep 2 hours for house-keeping. But since it was foggy in the morning we started at around 7:15 AM from Munnar. We had our return train to board at 10:00 PM from Kottayam, so we have decided to at most by 8:00 AM next day. Since we were quite excited about the house boat stuff we asked the driver to speed up. And he was driving at 80 Kmph on hilly tracks.

We could check-in at 1:00 PM. And on the boat no body understood any other language than Malyalam. We asked the driver to tell them that we want to get down at 8:00 because of our train. (We were thinking to utilize the maximum time we had on the boat)

The journey by cab was tiring and hot so we thought of taking a bath. But there was no water in the bathroom. Somehow we explained them about it. And they supplied us the water. Nobody even served drinking water in the rooms; we had to explain them in out sign language for this.

They started the boat took us into the back waters; I was thinking that now we will experience the real Kerela. However, after some time of ride they anchored the boat somewhere in a village and all of the 3 members went somewhere in the village. We asked them “where are they going”; they explained that they are going for lunch. BTW, there were nice paddy fields around and I got some opportunity to take some photographs. They returned after an hour. Till then we were dying of hunger. Then all of then went inside the kitchen for preparing lunch for us. So the boat didn't move a bit for next half-an-hour. Then we finished our lunch and went to the upper deck to see the view. It was 4:00 PM by then. They moved a bit and stopped again after some time and went somewhere. They refused to understand our questions of where they are going and came back only at 5:00 PM. Till then we were just thinking that anyway the night will be the great time and we all will be awake to experience the beauty, fighting over who will sleep on the deck.

They came back at 5:00 and we started the journey. The next 1- 1.5 hrs was the best time of the whole ride. Where we could see the lifestyle of the inhabitants of back waters, do some nice photography, and watched the sun-set. And as soon as the sun went off, they anchored the boat at a nearby place. We thought this must be for some evening tea etc. We asked them for tea, they replied ''no tea'' only ''lunch'' and ''dinner''. We got down from boat to the village nearby in search of tea shop, but couldn't find any. And when we returned we could see nobody on the boat, we found that they all are inside the kitchen. We asked for tea again explaining that we have paid a huge amount for this boat. They agreed to prepare tea but explained that people who come there give good tip to them (And surprisingly they could explain this very easily in English to us).

Then we came to know that the boat will be parked here for the whole night as they can't ride in nights. BANG!!! All my dreams of wonderful night were shattered, sleeping on the deck and playing ''Do lafzon ki hai...'' on my harmonica all night.

We got down and saw some other house boats parked nearby, most of them were occupied by foreigners, and we saw the boat people serving them drinks and nice snacks ( Off course they must have paid heavily followed by a huge tip for these goodies).

We came back and some how passed the time playing antakshari and stuff. Since it was hot inside the rooms, we decided to be awake for the whole night and enjoy at the deck, the best we can.

Dinner was served at 9:00 and this was slightly better then the lunch we got. (Or we were so starving by then, that we found it tasty). We finished the dinner and resumed our games, which we played till 11:00 PM. Though there were lots of mosquitoes, but the nice breeze was helping us to keep them away. At 11:00 the boat guys came and covered the whole boat with a tent, and kept their beddings on the deck. This made us understand that they are going to sleep here, and we decided to move to our rooms (4000Rs per night). Now since none of us was in a good mood, we asked them to take us back at 5:00 AM, as we have a train to board at 7:00.

Somehow we passed the night amidst suffocation, humid-heat and mosquitoes and became ready to leave by 4:00. They started the boat to take us back.

Now came the only second good part of the ride. We watched the beautiful sun-rise from the boat and finally came back to earth. They didn't serve breakfast because it is too early they only serve it at 7:00AM.

And even after all this when we were leaving all of the guys assembled around us asking for tip. But nobody of us was in a mood to move their hands to their wallets.

So that was the whole story about the so-called 22hrs ride along the heart of kerela (Venice of east) etc.

I will not recommend anybody to take such an overnight house boat in kerela. If you want to experience the backwaters, and lives of people there, it is far-far better to take a 2-3 hrs ride in the backwaters. I think there are some trips like this by a steamer or ferry. That will relieve you of all the ''hospitality'' of the house-boat fellows and will be far less burden on your pockets.",1
89,Kerala no doubt gods own country!!,"After a what is called a monotonous routine of office and part time studies ...there came the most awaited holiday .....a one to kerala ...decided as a three day trip.

Racing through the morning mists we reached Chalakudi by 11 am (traveling from my home at Coimbatore kerala seems very near),reached the Adirapally falls around 12 noon ..to view how wild nature can be ,the falls has a Max Elevation - 1116 m

raining most of the time and the mere presence sending chills through your spine. From there we moved to alleppey reaching around 5 pm.the resort we had booked for the night was a 2 -1 hr drive for the city. parking our car and taking the necessary luggage we head to the waters (in huge boat exclusively sailing for us).what surprises us is the experience change from narrow canals to wide rivers, lined on both sides by innumerable palm trees, stretch over 1900 km.

Large Kettuvalloms (traditional country crafts over 60 ft. in length) have been converted into luxury houseboats (costing around 2500 rs per day ),

Alleppey known as the Venice of the East, an intricate maze of canals and backwaters lined on both sides by lush greenery is the best heaven on earth for a evening ride .Alappuzha is famous for its spectacular snake boat races, unfortunately we were not able to see the spectacular scene (as we were leaving th previous day). Watching the sun set we travelled through the waters to reach our resort (150 tears old).

The resort was a homely one with a manager and a cook. after a sumptuous dinner we retired to sleep.the morning was fresh as ever with kookos singing , slight breeze , sun slighting beating down to show its presence....and water of course.....

feeling really sad leaving the heaven on earth we head further south to Trivandrum to pandhmanaban swamy temple.The temple is located inside the East Fort. Dedicated to Lord Vishnu, & a blend of the Kerala and Dravidian styles of architecture. It is known for its Mural Paintings and Stone Carvings. One among the 108 sacred Vishnu Temples in India, the presiding deity in here is Lord Vishnu reclining on anantha the serpent.

Having had a divine darshan we travelled to kanyakumari!!!",4
90,Welcome to the VENICE OF THE EAST,"The Venice of the East

----------------------------

Alapuzha, located in the central part of kerala, is one of the most beautiful places on earth. It is blessed with water bodies calm and serene, that the place is rightly called the Venice of the east.

The Italian city of Venice, is famous for its water logged streets which make boats the main transport system between houses. Would you believe that. You step out of the front door to your boat. It is certainly one of the most beautiful places on earth and no wonder that it has been the home of several artists and poets.

Now, our Venice of the east, Alapuzha, is certainly not like that, but is blessed with so many water bodies. It is certainly one of the most beautiful places on earth with its beautiful rivers and backwaters. The backwaters of kerala are world famous and attract many tourists round the year.

Not to mention the house boats of Alapuzha, which is one of the main tourist attractions of the state of kerala. Now who would not want to spent their vacation of a star accommodation on board a house boat floating in the crystal clear waters of the backwaters.

Another main attraction of the state is the kumarakom resort which was a major vacation getaway for the former prime minister and presidents of India. The Taj resorts of kumarakom are very famous in the tourist map of kerala.

Then coming to the boat races. The Nehru trophy boat race is also very famous in the national level. It is conducted on the second Saturday of august, every year. It is a very unique sight to see almost 100 persons on board a single boat ( traditional Snake boats), rowing to the rhythm of the century old songs, in perfect co-ordination, and the spectators repeating the tunes cheering for their favorite club to win the race.

Then comes the beaches of Alapuzha, which are also quite famous. But they have taken a toll after the recent tsunami which badly affected the coastal areas of the state.

Did I forget to mention Ayurveda, the ancient medicinal system of India, which has been crafted to a very high degree of perfection in kerala.

Also the land called the rice bowl of India, kuttanad, lies in Alapuzha. It is below the sea level, and is a pleasure to the eyes to see the endless rice fields and greenery all around.

All said and done, the biggest mistake about visiting Alapuzha, is going to the place without any knowledge of the major attractions. There is nothing much to see in the towns and the spirit lies entirely in the rural areas and its backwaters.

It is a very nice weekend getaway spot and hope you can enjoy the pleasures of the place.",5
91,"Journey by Kerala House boat., Is it really worth?","Hi friends....

I would like to make this short...but, let me see how it goes once I start writing..!!

Recently (April 1st week), I happen to visit Alleppy to check out what people say..the great house boats. And see what happens after I landed (by road though) into this city.

Arrival

I arrived here by road, started from Munnar at bout 8am and the drive is about 4.5 hours. The curvy roads from Munnar itself will take half of your energy away (even if you travel by an AC car) and if you are one of those, who has problem traveling on ghat roads and curvy roads, make sure you carry a lemon and a couple of vomiting tablets, seriously..!!

Once we reached Alleppy, the driver directly drove us to a House Boat agency, where a representative joined in our car and all of us reached the lake, where our boat is parked.

Journey Starts

Once we reached the house boat, the agent introduced us to his ''crew''. A Captain (who is wearing a lungi), a service boy (again lungi and banian) and cook(again a lungi, thats a standard here...but, would say, better dressed than his Captain :-)). Wait...this is just a start. We started asking them about the details of the boat, the journey time ..etc and then, to our shocking, none of the three crew members know any language except Malayalam and we don't know that language.

Then, our luggage was kept in a ''Bed Room'' and we were offered a mineral water bottle on arrival. So far, so good. The timing is about 1.30pm. We wanted to have a face wash, entered into the bath room, so dark out there and searched and searched and searched for the switch. Then came the second shock...There will be no Power till late evening and that’s how it is in house boats...came the answer from Captain.

Somehow, recovered from this shock, went to bathroom and opened the tap...and here's the third one..Tap water is RED, mixed with Mud, we somehow explained in sign language to the crew about the problem, then they did some magic to turn the flow in to BROWN, so we told ourselves to live with it (by the way, the water tastes as salty as it can get).

Lunch Time

After half an hour or so, cook asked us ''Veg'' or ''Non-Veg'', we told him ''Veg''. Then, he started telling some nice 3/4 south Indian curry names, we listened to them curiously and asked him, how long its going to take to prepare all of these? He said, they are ''Ready''. Surprising?? Better not to be. Then they stopped the boat immediately close to a shore.

We told him to get the food immediately as we are hungry and sweating in the heat, without any fan. He got us the food. No need to wonder, its cold, tasteless..papads are made like pooris and we had to limit ourselves with half stomach. Luckily, there are some fresh bananas and we banked on them for our lunch. A total of two hours is gone into this whole lunch episode and the boat is stopped for the entire duration.

Evening Ride

After Lunch, the crew had their lunch, cleaned up their plates and the bowls in the same ''Back Waters'' and at around 3.30pm, they started the boat again (so far, only half an hour journey in the boat). They drove for about 1.5 hours in the water, where we get to see how the villages on the banks of backwaters look like and how their daily life is... There are ''boat stops'' just like we have city bust stops, which is kind of interesting.

Sharply around 5.15pm, the boat came to a halt. They are not supposed to run house boats in the waters after this time, because the fishermen want their piece of mind (and water) too..!! We were hungry by this time and asked them whether they can prepare any snacks for us...phat came the reply, in half English and half Malayalam, something it sounded like ''they never heard these words snacks before''. Cook again asked us, what would like in the dinner, we immediately told chapati and some curry (since we had enough rice in the afternoon)

Night starts

It was 6.30pm, mosquitos are playing with our bodies and the crew had hard time understanding ''what a mosquito'' is. Finally they understood our sign language, and got us a ''Tortoise Coil'', which became a life saviour for us at that point. It's 7pm, still there are no signs of power(current). They told us that, power will come only after 7.15, 7.30pm. Do you want to know the reasons? I am sure, you would like to. They had a 20 meters long electric wire, through which they get power from near by house and provide power to the boat. Since its illegal to use household power for business use, they wait till it gets dark and all nearby village offices go back to their homes (won't they know otherwise?? :-)).

Current came at 7.30pm and dinner was ready by 8.30pm. What are we doing all this time on the boat?? Nothing, just chatting with mosquitos and looking around people of the villages, washing their clothes, taking head bath, cleaning their plates...all in the same water? Don't believe me? Go check it out..!! We had dinner, lucky to have one curry good out of 3 made and finished the same.

Sleep?

Its hot April and its sea shore and no signs of fresh air. All we have to depend is A 10 inch wide table fan, angled at the bed, which will not even rotate. We got the mosquito coil put near our head side of the bed and beared the blunt of mosquitos eating our legs... You have to save one part or another and we choose our ''head side part''.

Morning journey

Got up in the morning, 7'o clock and the power is gone. Brushed up with mineral water, we didn't have courage to take bath in that dark bathroom with brown water..so we choose to postpone bathing till we get out of that boat. By 8am, our famous cook prepared Poori as breakfast and needless to say (and some of u might of guessed it), they came like ''Papads''. The boat started its reverse journey, back to the shore and by 10am, we are back to the beautiful ''Land''.

Summary

What's the moral of the story? To me, lots of questions went through my mind. How these house boats are attracting tourists? Does all house boats the same? Luxury ones may not be, but those are expensive 10,000 onwards for a night (and ours is 5,000 a night)..!! Readers can comment if you have more details here.

Will I recommend this journey to any of my friends? Ans: Are you kidding?? No, never. Then, you all might ask me about this: I really want to enjoy back waters, how do we do that? Well, very simple...Go take a backwater resort, opt for a decent one with AC room. Check in there, and get onto their passenger boats, they take you on a cruise for about 3/4 hours after lunch and bring you back before mosquitos bite. Then, you can relax in your hotel and have some good food. So, you got luxury as well as the backwater ride..!! Sounds good? Take my word, you will be lucky if you do that.

Enjoy your next journey to Kerala. Comments are very well appreciated and will be used to improve my next review. Thanks in advance..!!

Cheers,

92,Alleppey Beach Resort' is Terrible!!!,"Hey All,

I just got back from Alleppey and have to post this about 'The Alleppey Beach Resort' This was the worst hotel my wife and I stayed at during our whole honeymoon in Kerala. I had asked the resort manager (Mr. Akshay Okumar) by email many, many times before I arrived, if the resort beach was private and clean, he responded by saying that it absolutely was. When my wife and I arrived they tried to give us a room where our neighbors were the local fishermen.

The beach by the way is in no sense of the word PRIVATE and is in fact a very much Public place. Every time my wife and I would swim in the water, the local men would come by to stare and hang around in a very threatening manner. In fact the hotel manager would come from the hotel and try to get them to leave. Unfortunately he could not because the beach is PUBLIC!!

My wife and I called it an early evening and then the next morning we got up early to go for a swim. Much to our surprise, we were greeted by a long line of men squatting in front of the resort and along the beach defecating, then going into the ocean to wash clean their behinds. We had decided to leave that instant. When I informed the hotel manager of the problems I was having he informed me of their ''NO REFUND'' policy.

When I told the manager that I had been in contact with a gentleman named Akshay Okumar via email and had been misled as to the beach being ''private and clean'' he got on the phone and offered to refund us 2000 Rupees. So my loss at the hotel ended up being 6000 Rupees . We ended up having to pay for all 3 nights minus the 2000 rupees they gave us back. When I asked to speak to some of the managers supervisors, I was informed that ''management does not want to speak to you.''

All in all trust me you really want to avoid this place at any cost.",1
93,The Boat house,"Kerala is one awesome place, I guess everyone agrees to it. Of all the places you intend to visit, do not miss out on Alleppey.


Me and my wife reached kerala by taxi from Kollam ( Aquaserene - backwater resort ), and again by taxi to allappey. We had already booked the houseboat through our travel agent. The boat was ready and so were the 3 attendents.One driver, one cook and one service boy.

To new comers the places appears a bit strange, but in 15 minutes we were amidst water, exploring the backwaters of kerala in true sense.

The boat itself is nice, with a neat bedroom, clean toilet and deck :-) with dining table.

For lunch the driver stops and prepares fresh fish and 3-4 other kerela curries.

Around 5 pm , there is a specified place where all boats stay for the night.

It cannot get more beautiful than that. Open sky, water all around...

If you plan to visit kerala, do not miss out on the boat house, it's worth every penny you pay.

Do take your alcohol along. You would miss it for sure. I did :-)",5
94,Backwater beauty,"It was a particularly dull and busy Saturday afternoon. There I was hard at work, while my hubby was out drinking with the boss. But no complaints, because that actually turned out to be a good thing.

At around 3 o clock I got a call from my hubby ''How soon can you pack? We are off to Kayaloram! Apparently the boss felt it was high time we poor work beleaguredI mortals had a holiday to recharge our creative batteries. See the plan? Get them fresh, thinking and get them working harder than ever! I quickly finished off my work, groveled to get the Monday off, ran home, packed a few changes of clothes and several hundred diapers. Then waving a gleeful goodbye to the in-laws (and several admonitions to drive carefully and to bring back our daughter without a scratch) we were off.

-------------------------

The trip

-------------------------

Kayaloram is in Ponnemada, a few kilometers outside Alleppey. Alleppey is definitely one of Kerala's hottest tourist spots, dubbed ahem, err..The Venice Of The South. It was popular way back in the 80s, long before resorts began popping up in every empty stretch of beach or backwater. Alleppey has a lovely beach and the backwaters are famous. It was dark by the time we got there and we had to ask for directions a few times. But on the whole the journey was fairly painless, especially since it takes only an hour and a half max from Cochin. The roads are pretty good too.

-------------------

The resort

-------------------

Finally driving to what seemed like the middle of nowhere, we reached a sandy clearing. This, it turned out, was the resort's parking lot. One of the retainers kindly led us through a path flanked by coconut trees and into the resort. Since it was dark, we could only discern that it was a typical Kerala style design, with well-maintained lawns and a view of the waterfront. Dinner was served in a covered courtyard style restaurant. I opted for phulkas and paneer, but most of the other guests had the house specials - seafood and Kerala style vegetables.

-------------------

The rooms

--------------------

Kayaloram Lake Resort has 12 rooms, each ostensibly built from materials transplanted from old homesteads in the state. Which means plenty of dark wood, tiled roofs, a skylight, traditional metal doors, simple design aesthetics. A fairly large bed meant that we could all snuggle together comfortably without fears of my daughter (then 8 months old) falling off the edge.

The room was quite cool even in mid afternoon. Off the bedroom was a courtyard style open-air bathroom - enclosed on all sides but roofless. At one corner was the shower stall. Once I was convinced that there were no wannabe porn filmmakers lurking near by, the open-air bathing was quite a thrill. There were a couple of slugs on the farthest wall - that was a back to nature experience I could have done without, but on the whole, rooms are clean, fresh and well maintained.

On Sunday morning, after a comfortable night, my husband stepped out for a smoke. I heard a gasp. Our door opened out into the lawn. Just beyond the lawn was a beautiful stretch of backwaters, silvery in the early morning light. It was truly lovely.

-------------------

The houseboat

-------------------

We had opted for a package, which included one night at the resort and one night on a houseboat. So mid morning on Sunday, we duly boarded a kettuvallom. Now tourist brochures (and I have written many!) will inform you that these kettuvalloms or houseboats were in fact country boats made of wood and coir rope. Now, they have been converted into houseboats comprising one or two bedrooms with attached bathrooms, a kitchen and a sundeck. A crew of 3, two boatmen and a cook, accompany you.

The houseboat goes through the miles and miles of backwater. Imagine traveling through roads of water - that pretty much gives you a feel of the ride. The progress is slow and stately, with lots of breaks for lunch, siesta, etc. There's a lot to see, so its okay. Food is cooked on board, and is unfussy, wholesome fare. Rice, thoren (sabzi) curry, fried fish. Extremely tasty though. Towards evening, my husband tried his hand at fishing with a line. Much to his chagrin, his attempts were rather like that of the cit in the feviquick commercial. Eventually, the boatman took the line from him and deftly caught half a dozen fish!

At around 6 o clock, the boat wound its way to a large opening and docked in the centre of the lake. Apparently all boats come to a halt after sundown, because that's when the fishermen put out their nets. It became eerily still. We had to turn down the power in some parts of the boat because the electricity runs on solar power.

The houseboat is perfect for honeymooners, who can lie on the sundeck and gaze on the stars. It's not so perfect for couples who have kids below 2 - you're just too scared to put your brat down, in case he or she falls overboard. Things are fun as long as the boat is moving, but can get a little claustrophobic once it weighs anchor for the night. There's no where to go, really. I don't remember the sunset, but the sunrise over the lake was really spectacular.

However all the basic amenities on the boat were excellent. Not surprising considering the bulk of those who go in for the houseboat are from abroad. On our way back the next day, we saw the huge water highway where the Nehru Trophy Boat race takes place annually. Massive. The boatman also pointed out the water routes to Cochin and Kottayam.

We reached the resort by 11 on Monday morning and lazed around, ate lunch and made our way reluctantly back to Cochin and our jobs.

--------------------

The verdict

--------------------

We went to Kayaloram Lake Resort in September, a month before the traditional tourist season in October. Our package was roughly Rs.6500/- all inclusive (off season rate). For that price, the facilities were excellent. The staff was warm and friendly, rather than sophisticated. While Kayaloram is not a very happening resort, it is fun and beautiful to boot. I didn't try out the pool or the ayurveda centre, so can't comment on those.

On a second visit, I would choose to skip the houseboat trip and spend more time at the resort itself. But for first timers the trip is a good idea. All in all, Kayaloram was a wonderful experience and I would definitely recommend it to all you travel freaks out there!",4
95,The Venice of the East,"It is no secret that Kerala is becoming one of India's premier tourist destinations, especially after having been listed by National Geographic as one of the top ten 'must see' places on earth.

One of my favourite places in Kerala is Alleppey with its backwaters. This town which is south of Cochin lies on a narrow land spit between the Arabian Sea and the mighty Vembanad Lake. This region boasts an impressive network of canals affectionately known as the backwaters which stretch over 1500 kms interconnecting some 44 rivers as well as lakes and lagoons.

The backwaters provide a lifeline to those good people who live along its banks. First and foremost it provides a means of transportation to otherwise inaccessible areas. The local economy is based on the coconut tree and its various spin offs....coconut oil., coir rope, mats and carpets.

One of the best ways to see this enchanting land is by KETTUVALAM which I can personally endorse as a novel means of transport. A kettuvalam is a large local boat about 67ft long and 13 ft wide, originally used to transport goods and produce. A few resourceful owners have converted their kettuvalams into houseboats for tourist purposes, each boat with at least 2 bedrooms with attached bathrooms, a living room and a kitchen. These boats can be hired on a daily basis with its crew of three who do all the navigating , cooking and cleaning between them.

I spent 2 days on such a boat touring the canals and learned a lot about life in rural Kerala. It was fascinating to see people go about their everyday business....children walking to school who would immediately wave and smile as they saw your boat...housewives washing dishes in the river...fishing, toddy tapping, paddy cultivation....a life far removed from the hassles and stress of modern living. The people I saw were so friendly and so full of life. It is an experience I shall never forget.

Another world famous attraction of Alleppey is the Nehru Trophy Boat Race which is held annually on the second Saturday of every August. The boats which are used are called CHUNDANVALAMS which translated means 'snake boat' describing its long and thin build. Each village enters its own snake boat which is manned by over a 100 oarsmen donning the village colours. It certainly is a very colourful and lively affair with the village pride at stake. It is the FORMULA ONE of the backwater....if you like.

With the expansion of tourism in this area it is not surprising that the big luxury hotels have moved in , particularly in Kumarakom along Lake Vembanad. However the developers have been sensitive so as not to upset the charm and tranquility of this special place. The buildings consist of bungalows and are built in the TARAWAD or old kerala style using wood, coir and other natural materials.

No trip to India is complete without visiting Kerala...and no trip to Kerala is complete without experiencing the backwaters...... LET YOURSELF BE AMAZED....",5
96,,"Beach was good and clean. We went early in the morning around 5:30. Sunrise was an amazing here. It was so pleasant inthe morning and there is less crowd. Better to visit in the morning to avoid crowd.

You can see different activities going on there. There will be fishing and some will playing cricket and volleyball. You can enjoy it.",5
97,,"Badly kept beach, authorities have no concern for future generations. Parking fee is charged (parking in road), for what purpose it's not clear. No money spend for sustainable solutions, atleast 10% parking fee collected must be used for sustainable beach development activities.",1
98,,"Nice beach, best to visit early morning. Most of the time its very crowded. Man count can reach 1000+ most days. The remains of the sea bridge is a great attraction of this beach. The best view of the beach is from the bypass road, if its sunset then its superb.",3
99,,"Alappuzha Beach is known for its picturesque beauty and serene surroundings. The beach stretches along the Arabian Sea and offers stunning views of the coastline. The golden sandy shores, gentle waves, and palm-fringed promenade make it a delightful spot for visitors. The beach is also known for its various recreational activities. Visitors can engage in beach volleyball, cricket, and other beach sports. The calm waters make it suitable for swimming, although caution is advised as there might be strong undercurrents at times. Additionally, there are options for boat rides and fishing trips for those interested in exploring the backwaters of Kerala.",4
100,,"Beach was good but crowded. Be careful while while parking cars and bike since we have faced a bad experience from an auto driver from there, he was drunk and nicely crashed on our car and left without saying anything. car door had be replaced.
Other than that if you lucky u can purchase fresh fish.",4
